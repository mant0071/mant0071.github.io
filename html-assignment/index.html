        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jordan Mantulak-Lang, this is my 1<sup>st</sup> year
            in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin college. I have a background in commerce,
            but have spent the last decade traveling the world and working in restaurants. 
            COVID has changed the world of restaurants and travel drastically, so I've decided to adapt! After a decade-long 
            academic hiatus, I'm back and excited to learn again!
            
        <p>
            In my spare time I love to play music and be outside. My two true passions in life are tiki drinks and disco music.
            I should've been born in the 70's! I also really enjoy social media marketing, mainly working on <em>Instagram</em>. 
            I really enjoy helping brands realize their vision, and have done a lot of work 
            with various local restaurants over the years. Although I have a bit of a digital background, 
            this web design course will definitely be difficult for me! Looking forward to it though.
