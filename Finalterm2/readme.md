About this project. 

Overall, the completed work went a little faster than I thought. 
However, there were for sure a few struggles that I was aware would come up when doing my mockups. Firstly, the layout of the desktop version varies wildly from the tablet and mobile versions. This is my first time trying to code a such a varying responsive layout and has proven to be difficult. Everything was pretty smooth sailing until then.  I started playing with bootstrap while laying out my html, and although I used a few elements, I definitely prefer to do my layout almost entirely in CSS. The Bootstrap elements I did use, however, were super helpful. Another challenge was creating pop up windows for my portfolio elements: something I have never done before. Have learned quite a bit about how to use this using JS and Boostrap. 
It's been a good learning experience overall, and am excited to give this a bit more polish in the weeks to come.

Thanks for the semester!
